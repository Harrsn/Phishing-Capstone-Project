## PROPOSED APPROACH TO DETECT PHISHING USING NEURAL NETWORKS
1. Preprocess the data to remove any unnecessary data, such as null values.
2. Use feature extraction based on phishing URL research to convert English content to numerical
data that the computer can understand.
3. Determine the dataset's general information, such as the summary and the number of safe and
unsafe rows.
4. Divide the newly created numerical dataset into two distinct sets: training and testing.
5. Create a callback function to monitor loss and adjust learning rates as needed, as well as to stop
the model once it reaches a certain average accuracy rate.
6. Train and test a variety of models for various optimizers, including Adam, RMSProp, and SGD,
each with three hidden layers, two with 512 nodes and one with 256 nodes and Sigmoid
activation function.
7. Evaluate the model to determine the loss and accuracy of the prepared model for each
optimizer and compare them.
8. Retrain and test with the same optimizers, but this time the first two hidden layers have only 
512 nodes while the last hidden node has 1024 nodes and Sigmoid activation function. The loss
function is "binary cross-entropy" in both cases because it is ideal for binary classification.
9. Compare and evaluate the results generated by both models for the specific optimizers.
10. Finally, use Swarm Intelligence/TDLHBA to improve the outcome.
