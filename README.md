# Phishing Detection: Using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and reports from my Capstone research project in my final year at Bridgevalley CTC for the Associate of Applied Science in Cyber Security & Network Technology degree. <br>
To study different types of phishing attacks with real-time examples and demonstrate how they occur, I made a program using **shell script**, **PHP**, and **HTML**.<br>
My main objective was met by developing and improving phishing URL detection using **neural networks with different optimizers and hyperparameters**.<br>
For my machine learning, [this dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites) was used.<br><br>

## Abstract
Phishing is a type of cybercrime where attackers send spam emails and create fake websites to trick people into entering their sensitive credentials and data. The goal of this paper is to study modern-day phishing attacks, analyze the URLs and fake websites to identify clues and patterns that can indicate whether they are safe or not, and develop an algorithm to automate the classification process. Classification is a machine learning technique that can be used to identify spam by building and testing models with various hyperparameters. I compared different machine learning algorithms and evaluated the accuracy of a trained model using multiple metrics. During this study, I identified 26 patterns or anomalies that can indicate that a web application is a phishing website. I also used a neural network with Adam, SGD, and RMSProp optimizers. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the results changed when using a swarm intelligence technique with the TDLHBA parameter.
